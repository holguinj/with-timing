# Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

Here's the process I greatly prefer for contributions:
  1. Check the [issues](https://github.com/holguinj/with-timing/issues) page to see if your feature/fix has been requested.
  2. If not, consider filing an issue first to get feedback and/or approval.
  3. Open a PR that contains the changes, plus any necessary docs and tests.

For small bug fixes, you can probably skip #2 above. Any totally new features should really have an issue filed first.

All contributors are bound by this project's [code of conduct](https://github.com/holguinj/with-timing/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
In particular, I expect contributors, prospective contributors, and users to maintain some basic level of decency towards one another.
